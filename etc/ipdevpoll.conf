[snmp]
#
# Default SNMP polling parameters
# If there are slow devices on your network (i.e. ipdevpoll logs show they
# keep timing out), consider either increasing the timeout value (seconds) or
# decreasing the max-repetitions value used for GET-BULK operations.

#
# Setting the throttle delay value will ensure a delay of this many seconds
# between each an every SNMP request packet in a single SNMP session. This can
# be good for devices with poor SNMP implementations, but it is generally a bad
# idea to set this globally.

 The inventory job is set up to run every 6 hours to collect all bits of
 inventory information, from dns names, type, modules, interfaces
 (switch and router ports), vlan and prefix information.

# unlimited concurrency.  Polling thousands of devices concurrently may result
# in high system load.  Limiting concurrency can help reduce the load.

 This job runs plugins that check on the status of various internal components

# contained within it, or equal to it. E.g. <<=127.0.0.0/8 will match
# 127.0.1.0/24. This is the default operator if omitted.
#
# An address prefixed by the = operator will only match subnets that equal it.
#
