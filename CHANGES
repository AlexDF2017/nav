Version 3.0.0
(released 16 September 2005)

 Improvements:

 * Fixed a bug in maintengine which prevented it from doing it's job when the
   database was busy/overloaded.

 * Fixed a bug in the integration between Alert Profiles (PHP) and the Cheetah
   templating system (Python), which would cause the Alert Profiles web
   interface to act up.

 * Character coding information added to all NAV-original Python programs.

 * Fixed a bug which cleared a user's password if the account editing form of
   Useradmin was submitted without changes.

 * NetworkDiscovery now only checks for closed vlans on active ports.

 * Fixed a NullPointerException in getDeviceData.

 * Fixed various problems with Cisco module/submodule translation in
   getDeviceData.

 * Fixed a AlertEngine/getDeviceData combination bug which caused AlertEngine
   to log loads of long error messages on events that lacked an alerttype
   suggestion.

 * New option to have AlertEngine log error messages to a separate error log.

 * AlertEngine now sends error alerts if an alerttype has no configured subject
   line in alertmsg.conf.

 * Added report shortcut to search for strings in prefix-netident (added to the
   front.html config file)

 * Added link from Report to the previously hidden feature "service matrix" of
   the IP Device Center (added to the front.html config file)


Version 3.0_rc2
(released 20 July 2005)

 Improvements:

 * More data for the snmpoid table, please run the new snmpoid.sql to
   ensure your system will work after an upgrade.

 * The Service Monitor's RPC plugin no longer complains loudly to
   stderr.

 * The Messages and Report web interfaces will no longer
   intermittently cross-over mysteriously.

 * The alert message texts have been updated to contain messages for
   all known alerts.

 * Overlapping time periods in an alert profile will no longer cause
   double alerts to be sent.

 * Modules that are down can now actually be found and deleted in the
   Device Management interface.

 * The Traffic Map system and Network Explorer can now be properly
   configured to run without a single NAV root directory.

 * Alert Profiles web pages now include the correct stylesheets, so it
   won't look as funny.

 * Several getDeviceData-related problems were ironed out.

 * The menu on Messages' maintenance list is no longer ugly.

 * IP devices put on maintenance will now be taken off maintenance,
   instead of remaining on maintenance forever.

 * Maintenance-scheduled IP devices can now be properly deleted from
   messages.

 * Next/previous page-links in reports will now work properly even
   when using advanced search options.  Also, advanced searching on
   database fields that contain underscores (like sw_ver) will now
   work.

 * Performance improvements in the IP Device Center.

 Improvements:

 * Eventengine BoxState plugin now uses a queue for boxes down in
   order to ensure that we don't send out boxdown alerts prematurely.

 * The Gwport plugin of getDeviceData has been rewritten and should
   be much more stable (less restarts of gDD necessary).

 * Most of the reports in the report generator have been optimized and
   will display much more quickly than before.

 * Various improvements to Cricket to better cope with changes. This
   should make vlanPlot display the network load more reliably.

 * Send email for boxShadow and boxSunny.

 * WLAN devices are correctly detected as being in shadow.

 * Only allow editing of prefixes where the nettype table says it's
   editable.

 * Attempt to fix several instances of bad HTML markup in the report
   generator, which would break on various browsers.

 * Attempt to get the module number of Cisco devices correct in more
   cases.

 * Handle the case of duplicate module serials in a graceful manner.

 * gDD collects data every 6 hours by default, although the default
   is only for new devices. The collection frequency can be changed by
   setting the 'frequency' field in the netboxsnmpoid table, and the
   default value can be changed in getDeviceData.conf.

 * Add option for setting the logging level for NAV subsystems in
   nav.conf.

 * Try to also discover closed / private VLANs.

 * Support for PIDs > 65535 in pping (typical on FreeBSD).

 * Add a 'monitor' thread to the cam-logger which exits the process
   if it hangs for some reason.

 * Using a separate database server has been tested and all NAV
   subsystems should now support this.

 Improvements:

 * gDD now makes sure to give priority to new devices when its work
   load with old devices is high.
 * gDD now refers to IP Devices by sysname in its logs, making it
   easier to track its actions when reading the logs.
 * gDD now correctly updates the netident of elinks.
 * gDD will now also attempt to extract software version information
   from a device's sysDescr OID (also collects sw_ver for the device
   itself, and not just its modules).
 * A bug that prevented the service monitor's LDAP plugin from
   functioning from time to time was fixed.
 * Router ports that are administratively down are removed from NAVdb
   by gDD.
 * The report generator now supports multi-line and complex SQL
   queries.
 * The SQL queries of the netbox, gw, sw, edge and wlan reports were
   optimized for speed.

 Additions:

 * gDD will now collect memory information from devices.


Version 3.0_beta9
(released 21 January 2005)

 User-visible changes:
 
 * For performance reasons, the WestHawk Java SNMP library has been
   discarded in favor of Java SNMP, which has a nice GPL license and
   doesn't hog resources by creating lots of threads.
 * Machine tracker searches have been redone to be more like in NAV 2,
   due to the complexity of automatic attempts at correlating CAM and
   ARP records.1
 * Makecricketconfig should now generate correct interface
   descriptions for router interfaces in Cricket.
 * The previously disabled Server statistics support of
   Makecricketconfig has ben re-enabled and fixed.
 * Start/stop scripts now use "su -" when switching from root to
   navcron, to reset the environment before starting processes.  This
   may have adverse effects if root has his/her environment variables
   set to locate NAV libraries while the navcron user doesn't.
 * The report system should now correctly count the number of gwports
   registered for a device in NAVdb.
 * Edit database no longer throws exceptions if NAVdb contains
   organizations without descriptions.
 * The default priorities of the web tools have been adjusted.
 * getDeviceData should no longer come out of sync with NAVdb, as it
   no longer works on a memory cache of the NAVdb.
 * getDeviceData no longer deletes prefixes of the 'scope' type (which
   makes the prefix matrix of the Report system work again).
 * Improvements to the module monitor of getDeviceData.
 * Load data is now available in the Traffic map.

Known bugs in this version:

 * getDeviceData will at times seemingly "forget" some IP devices and
   stop retrieving updated information from them.  Until this has been
   fixed, this can be worked around by restarting getDeviceData,
   either on a regular basis, or when inconsistencies between NAVdb
   and the real world are seen.

 User-visible changes:
 * Encoding info has been added to several python modules, to make
   newer versions of Python stop complaining about PEP 0263.  But
   there are probably more modules that need these changes.
 * Attempting to stop not running cron services using the nav command
   will no longer yield a Python exception.
 * Alert profiles containing time periods spanning across midnight
   will now work.
 * Interface names containing more than one forward slash now work
   with makecricketconfig.
 * Added config file cricket-views.conf to define which views
   makecricketconfig will create.
 * Several editdb crash bugs were fixed.
 * Default set of reports (report.conf) were bugfixed.
 * MachineTracker had a serious design flaw in its primary SQL
   statement, which would cause arbitrary and erroneous search result.
   The automatic combination of arp and cam data should now be more
   accurate.
 * When there are no active messages, the annoying "No Found" message
   is no longer displayed on the home page.
 * Some missing icons have been added, and new icons for some tools.
 * Some strange errors on the web were due to small differences in
   mod_python versions used on Apache 1.3 and Apache 2, the ones that
   have been found have been fixed.
 * Tremendous amount of fixes related to the getDeviceData collection
   system, more accurate collection of module information and module
   state, detection of replaced netboxes, etc.
 * Errors in getDeviceData and missing constraints in the database
   would sometimes cause several netboxes and/or several modules to
   refer to the same device and serial number (which is supposed to be
   impossible).  This has been fixed.
 * Improvements to vlanPlot layout, including links to IP device
   center and Network Explorer.  Will now also display an error
   message when contact cannot be establishwith the vPServer, whereas
   previously it would only present a blank screen.
