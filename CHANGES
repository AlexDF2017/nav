 Improvements:

 * gDD now makes sure to give priority to new devices when its work
   load with old devices is high.
 * gDD now refers to IP Devices by sysname in its logs, making it
   easier to track its actions when reading the logs.
 * gDD now correctly updates the netident of elinks.
 * gDD will now also attempt to extract software version information
   from a device's sysDescr OID (also collects sw_ver for the device
   itself, and not just its modules).
 * A bug that prevented the service monitor's LDAP plugin from
   functioning from time to time was fixed.
 * Router ports that are administratively down are removed from NAVdb
   by gDD.
 * The report generator now supports multi-line and complex SQL
   queries.
 * The SQL queries of the netbox, gw, sw, edge and wlan reports were
   optimized for speed.

 Additions:

 * gDD will now collect memory information from devices.


Version 3.0_beta9
(released 21 January 2005)

 User-visible changes:
 
 * For performance reasons, the WestHawk Java SNMP library has been
   discarded in favor of Java SNMP, which has a nice GPL license and
   doesn't hog resources by creating lots of threads.
 * Machine tracker searches have been redone to be more like in NAV 2,
   due to the complexity of automatic attempts at correlating CAM and
   ARP records.1
 * Makecricketconfig should now generate correct interface
   descriptions for router interfaces in Cricket.
 * The previously disabled Server statistics support of
   Makecricketconfig has ben re-enabled and fixed.
 * Start/stop scripts now use "su -" when switching from root to
   navcron, to reset the environment before starting processes.  This
   may have adverse effects if root has his/her environment variables
   set to locate NAV libraries while the navcron user doesn't.
 * The report system should now correctly count the number of gwports
   registered for a device in NAVdb.
 * Edit database no longer throws exceptions if NAVdb contains
   organizations without descriptions.
 * The default priorities of the web tools have been adjusted.
 * getDeviceData should no longer come out of sync with NAVdb, as it
   no longer works on a memory cache of the NAVdb.
 * getDeviceData no longer deletes prefixes of the 'scope' type (which
   makes the prefix matrix of the Report system work again).
 * Improvements to the module monitor of getDeviceData.
 * Load data is now available in the Traffic map.

Known bugs in this version:

 * getDeviceData will at times seemingly "forget" some IP devices and
   stop retrieving updated information from them.  Until this has been
   fixed, this can be worked around by restarting getDeviceData,
   either on a regular basis, or when inconsistencies between NAVdb
   and the real world are seen.

 User-visible changes:
 * Encoding info has been added to several python modules, to make
   newer versions of Python stop complaining about PEP 0263.  But
   there are probably more modules that need these changes.
 * Attempting to stop not running cron services using the nav command
   will no longer yield a Python exception.
 * Alert profiles containing time periods spanning across midnight
   will now work.
 * Interface names containing more than one forward slash now work
   with makecricketconfig.
 * Added config file cricket-views.conf to define which views
   makecricketconfig will create.
 * Several editdb crash bugs were fixed.
 * Default set of reports (report.conf) were bugfixed.
 * MachineTracker had a serious design flaw in its primary SQL
   statement, which would cause arbitrary and erroneous search result.
   The automatic combination of arp and cam data should now be more
   accurate.
 * When there are no active messages, the annoying "No Found" message
   is no longer displayed on the home page.
 * Some missing icons have been added, and new icons for some tools.
 * Some strange errors on the web were due to small differences in
   mod_python versions used on Apache 1.3 and Apache 2, the ones that
   have been found have been fixed.
 * Tremendous amount of fixes related to the getDeviceData collection
   system, more accurate collection of module information and module
   state, detection of replaced netboxes, etc.
 * Errors in getDeviceData and missing constraints in the database
   would sometimes cause several netboxes and/or several modules to
   refer to the same device and serial number (which is supposed to be
   impossible).  This has been fixed.
 * Improvements to vlanPlot layout, including links to IP device
   center and Network Explorer.  Will now also display an error
   message when contact cannot be establishwith the vPServer, whereas
   previously it would only present a blank screen.
