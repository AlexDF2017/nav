 User-visible changes:
 * Encoding info has been added to several python modules, to make
   newer versions of Python stop complaining about PEP 0263.  But
   there are probably more modules that need these changes.
 * Attempting to stop not running cron services using the nav command
   will no longer yield a Python exception.
 * Alert profiles containing time periods spanning across midnight
   will now work.
 * Interface names containing more than one forward slash now work
   with makecricketconfig.
 * Added config file cricket-views.conf to define which views
   makecricketconfig will create.
 * Several editdb crash bugs were fixed.
 * Default set of reports (report.conf) were bugfixed.
 * MachineTracker had a serious design flaw in its primary SQL
   statement, which would cause arbitrary and erroneous search result.
   The automatic combination of arp and cam data should now be more
   accurate.
 * When there are no active messages, the annoying "No Found" message
   is no longer displayed on the home page.
 * Some missing icons have been added, and new icons for some tools.
 * Some strange errors on the web were due to small differences in
   mod_python versions used on Apache 1.3 and Apache 2, the ones that
   have been found have been fixed.
 * Tremendous amount of fixes related to the getDeviceData collection
   system, more accurate collection of module information and module
   state, detection of replaced netboxes, etc.
 * Errors in getDeviceData and missing constraints in the database
   would sometimes cause several netboxes and/or several modules to
   refer to the same device and serial number (which is supposed to be
   impossible).  This has been fixed.
 * Improvements to vlanPlot layout, including links to IP device
   center and Network Explorer.  Will now also display an error
   message when contact cannot be establishwith the vPServer, whereas
   previously it would only present a blank screen.
