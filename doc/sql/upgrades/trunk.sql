 * This preliminary SQL script is designed to upgrade your NAV database from
 * version 3.3 to the current trunk revision.  Please update this with every
 * change you make to the database initialization scripts.  It will eventually
 * become the update script for the next release.
 *
 * Also, if you are keeping your installation in sync with trunk, you should
 * watch this file for changes and run them when updating (check the diffs!)
 *
 * Connect to PostgreSQL as the postgres superuser or the nav database user
 * like this:
 *
 *  psql -f trunk.sql manage <username>
