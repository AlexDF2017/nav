/*
 *
 * This preliminary SQL script is designed to upgrade your NAV
 * database from version 3.4 to the current trunk revision (i.e. the
 * tip of the default development branch).  Please update this with
 * every change you make to the database initialization scripts.  It
 * will eventually become the update script for the next release.
 *
 * Also, if you are keeping your installation in sync with the default
 * branch, you should watch this file for changes and run them when
 * updating (check the diffs!)
 *
 * Connect to PostgreSQL as the postgres superuser or the nav database user
 * like this:
 *
 *  psql -f trunk.sql manage <username>
 *
