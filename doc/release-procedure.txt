Checklist for creating a new stable release for NAV
===================================================

Check milestone (for the next release) in Launchpad (https://launchpad.net/nav)
  - Are all bugs fixed?
  - Unfixed bugs must be retargeted/untargeted to make the release deadline?

Check hudson (nav.uninett.no/hudson)
  - Are there any red/yellow lights on the branch to be releases?
  - Red light means that we can not release

Check out the release branch from the mercurial
   hg clone http://nav.uninett.no/hg/series/3.9.x

OBS OBS: when you do 'hg clone', your working copy will be on the
default branch. Update to correct branch by doing:
   hg up 3.9.x

To update your working copy later do
   hg pull

To view branches, do 
   hg glog | less

Compare changesets with bugs from Launchpad
  hg log-r 3.9.0: tip-v |. / tools / buglog.py
  Update CHANGES with the new fixes, check that all the bugs are resolved
