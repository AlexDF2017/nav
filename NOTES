===========================
 Release notes for NAV 3.5
===========================
Please report bugs at https://bugs.launchpad.net/nav

If you are upgrading from versions of NAV older than 3.4, please refer
to the release notes of the in-between versions before reading any
further.


Upgrading from NAV 3.4
======================

Database changes
----------------
Whereas NAV 3.4 used four separate PostgreSQL databases (manage,
navprofiles, logger and arnold) to store its data, NAV 3.5 uses a
single database.

Before running the normal SQL upgrade procedure (i.e. SQL scripts from
doc/sql/upgrades/), you MUST merge your four existing NAV databases
into a single nav database.  The shell script doc/sql/mergedb.sh can
help you with this.  Se doc/sql/upgrades/README for more information.


Dependency changes
------------------
The following dependencies are new to NAV 3.5:

* python-django >= 1.0 (http://www.djangoproject.com)
* psycopg2 (in addition to psycopg1, 
  http://www.initd.org/pub/software/psycopg/)

The following are no longer dependencies in NAV 3.5:

* Tomcat
* PHP
* The perl modules DBD::Pg and SNMP_Session
