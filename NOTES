 Release notes for NAV 3.4
===========================
Please report bugs at https://bugs.launchpad.net/nav

If you are upgrading from versions of NAV older than 3.3.3, please refer to the
release notes of the in-between versions before reading any further.


Netmap
======

NAV 3.4 comes with a preview of the Traffic Map replacement, called
Netmap.  This tool is not feature complete yet, but we hope you will
test it and provide us with feedback.  Is the new tool useful?  What
could we do differently?

For more information and user documentation for Netmap, please refer
to http://metanav.uninett.no/netmap .


IP Device Info
==============

The IP Device Center and IP Info tools are being rewritten from
scratch as a new subsystem called IP Device Info, with radically
improved response times over the old IP Device Center.  A preview of
this new tool is included in NAV 3.4, in parallel with the old tools.

To try out this new tool, you will need to install an SVN version of
Django, a Python web framework.  The minimum required version is SVN
revision 7189 of Django.  You can get the latest trunk revision using
svn thus:

  svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/

You will also need python-psycopg2 in addition to python-psycopg
(version 1).  If you need to install from source, it can be found
here:

  http://www.initd.org/pub/software/psycopg/

For more information about Django in general, please refer to
http://www.djangoproject.com/ .

Upgrading to NAV 3.4.3
======================
NAV 3.4.2 contained fixes to a database schema problem that affects
machine tracker history.

Unfortunately, a bug in the SQL upgrade script prevented it from
working correctly.  3.4.3 fixes the bugs in the script, and the same
rules for upgrading to 3.4.3 apply as for 3.4.2.

If either one of the two following cases apply to you, you will need
to manually run the SQL upgrade script to fix these problems:

 1. You installed NAV 3.4 from scratch (not as an upgrade), creating a
    new database.
 
   or
 
 2. You are running PostgreSQL 8.3 or newer.

The upgrade script is located as doc/sql/upgrades/3.4.2.sql - see the
comments inside the script for more information on how to run it (It
won't hurt to run it even if you don't need to).

If you installed NAV from a Debian binary package, the upgrade process
should have automatically run this upgrade script for you.


Upgrading from NAV 3.3
======================

Arnold
------
Arnold, the port blocking system, has been reimplemented in Python,
and now has support for changing vlans on switch ports, in addition to
the usual port blocking.  It's config files and scripts have changed
names; if you've set up a cron job running t1000.pl or other jobs
calling the old Perl scripts, these will need to be updated.  You
should also check the new config files if you have made local changes
to the old ones.

LDAP
----
If you have been using NAV's LDAP authentication ability, please
update your webfront.conf file.  The config has changed slightly, now
allowing for TLS connections, attribute configuration and required
group memberships; i.e. you can now require LDAP users to be members
of a specific LDAP group to be allowed to log in to NAV at all.  This
removes the requirement to have a separate sub-tree of NAV user
objects in your official LDAP directory.

Dependency changes
------------------
Please note that NAV now requires Java 1.5 to compile.  Also note that
if you wish to test the new IP Device Info preview, you will need to
install Django and psycopg2, as mentioned earlier in the release
notes.
