 Release notes for NAV 3.3
===========================
Please report bugs at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nav

If you are upgrading from versions of NAV older than 3.2.2, please refer to the
release notes of the in-between versions before reading any further.

SNMP Trap daemon
================

NAV 3.3 features a new, plugin-based SNMP trap daemon.  The process is called
snmptrapd, and will start by default along with the rest ov NAV when the "nav
start" command is issued.

The trap daemon currently comes with two plugins, or traphandlers (sic) as the
snmptrapd calls them.  One handles LINKUP and LINKDOWN traps from equipment,
translating these into NAV linkState events.  The resulting linkUp/linkDown
alerts can be subscribed to through the Alert Profiles subsystem.  The second
plugin handles access point association/disassociation traps (sent when dumb
access points associate or disassociate with the controller, not when wireless
clients associate with access points) from a Cisco WLAN Controller, translating
these into NAV events which can also be subscribed to.

For further snmptrapd docs, see subsystem/snmptrapd/README .


Upgrading from NAV 3.2.2
========================

Database schema changes
-----------------------
NAV 3.3 makes various small changes to the database tables containing
historical machine tracker data.  Measurements show that updating the schema
with these changes will run about 33 times slower on PostgreSQL 7.4 than on
PostgreSQL 8.1.  No, this is not a typo, we literally mean _thirty-three_ times
slower.  The actual running time will vary with the number of records present
in the tables.

The provided upgrade script employs a schema change syntax that was first
introduced in PostgreSQL 8, and will consequently not work on a PostgreSQL 7.4
installation.  While more complex, 7.4-compatible syntax is provided in the
script comments, it is highly recommended to upgrade to PostgreSQL 8 before
upgrading NAV to version 3.3, as this minimizes the amount of downtime.

Although NAV 3.3 will most certainly run fine on PostgreSQL 7.4 after an
upgrade, it is likely that future NAV releases will use non-backwards
compatible PostgreSQL 8 syntax.  We therefore recommend upgrading as soon as
possible.
