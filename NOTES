 Release notes for NAV 3.7
===========================
Please report bugs at https://bugs.launchpad.net/nav

If you are upgrading from versions of NAV older than 3.6, please refer
to the release notes of the in-between versions before reading any
further.

Known problems
==============
The latest TwistedSNMP version (0.3.13) contains a bug that manifests
in table retrival operations.  Timeouts and retries aren't handled
properly, and this may cause slow or otherwise busy devices to be
bombarded with requests from NAV.  The contrib/patches directory
contains a patch for TwistedSNMP that solves this problem.  The patch
has been submitted upstream, but not yet accepted into a new release.
