 Release notes for NAV 3.5
===========================
Please report bugs at https://bugs.launchpad.net/nav

If you are upgrading from versions of NAV older than 3.4, please refer
to the release notes of the in-between versions before reading any
further.


Netmap vs. Traffic Map
======================

The Traffic Map has been superseded by the Netmap.  Netmap does not
require a Java servlet backend, and in combination with a rewrite of
Network Explorer this means Tomcat is no longer needed for a NAV
installation.

If, for any reason, you really miss the old Traffic Map, you can find
it as a contrib under contrib/trafficmap/.  Refer to
contrib/trafficmap/README for installation instructions.


Upgrading from NAV 3.4
======================

Database changes
----------------
Whereas NAV 3.4 used four separate PostgreSQL databases (manage,
navprofiles, logger and arnold) to store its data, NAV 3.5 uses a
single database.

Before running the normal SQL upgrade procedure (i.e. SQL scripts from
doc/sql/upgrades/), you MUST merge your four existing NAV databases
into a single nav database.  The shell script doc/sql/mergedb.sh can
help you with this.  Se doc/sql/upgrades/README for more information.


Removed HP SwitchStack support
------------------------------
Support for HP SwitchStacks has been removed from NAV.  The support
was implemented in a hackish way, and disrupted support for any HP
devices that weren't SwitchStacks.

If you do monitor HP equipment with NAV, you will likely find some
problems with HP data collected by your old NAV version.  You may
experience that HP modules are reported as down, statistics for
existing interfaces may cease to be updated, and NAV may register
duplicate interfaces on your HP devices.

These problems can be resolved by making NAV forget about all
previously registered modules on HP devices, and let it rediscover
them from scratch.  An SQL script is provided to do just that.

This script can be found as doc/sql/upgrades/3.5.0b2-hpfix.sql.
Please refer to the instructions in the comments in that file.


Dependency changes
------------------
The following dependencies are new to NAV 3.5:

* python-django >= 1.0 (http://www.djangoproject.com)
* psycopg2 (in addition to psycopg1,
  http://www.initd.org/pub/software/psycopg/)

The following are no longer dependencies in NAV 3.5:

* Tomcat
* PHP
* The Perl modules DBD::Pg and SNMP_Session
* The Python module forgetHTML


Files to remove
---------------
These files and directories should be removed from your installation
after the upgrade:

apache/tools/editdb.tool
apache/tools/vlanPlot.tool
apache/tools/navAdmin.tool
apache/webroot/editdb/
apache/webroot/js/editdbTemplate.js
apache/webroot/style/editdbTemplate.css
apache/webroot/images/toolbox/tools/editdb.png
lib/python/nav/web/templates/editdbTemplate.py

You should rename etc/editdb.conf to etc/seeddb.conf if you have any
local changes to editdb.conf.

These files and directories are all prefixed with /usr/local/nav/ in a
default configuration, but your mileage may vary.
