 Release notes for NAV 3.4
===========================
Please report bugs at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nav

If you are upgrading from versions of NAV older than 3.3.3, please refer to the
release notes of the in-between versions before reading any further.


Netmap
======

NAV 3.4 comes with a preview of the Traffic Map replacement, called
Netmap.  This tool is not feature complete yet, but we hope you will
test it and provide us with feedback.  Is the new tool useful?  What
could we do differently?

For more information and user documentation for Netmap, please refer
to http://metanav.uninett.no/netmap .


IP Device Info
==============

The IP Device Center and IP Info tools are being rewritten from
scratch as a new subsystem called IP Device Info, with radically
improved response times over the old IP Device Center.  A preview of
this new tool is included in NAV 3.4, in parallel with the old tools.


Upgrading from NAV 3.3
======================

Arnold, the port blocking system, has been reimplemented in Python,
and now has support for changing vlans on switch ports, in addition to
the usual port blocking.  It's config files and scripts have changed
names; if you've set up a cron job running t1000.pl or other jobs
calling the old Perl scripts, these will need to be updated.  You
should also check the new config files if you have made local changes
to the old ones.

If you have been using NAV's LDAP authentication ability, please
update your webfront.conf file.  The config has changed slightly, now
allowing for TLS connections, attribute configuration and required
group memberships; i.e. you can now require LDAP users to be members
of a specific LDAP group to be allowed to log in to NAV at all.  This
removes the requirement to have a separate sub-tree of NAV user
objects in your official LDAP directory.
