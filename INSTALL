Installing NAV
==============
NB! The build system has not been implemented throughout the entire project
hierarchy yet, so this may not work.  Check individuel INSTALL files in
subdirectories for more detailed installation instructions.


To install NAV, do the following:

# sh configure
# make
# make install


Configuring NAV
===============
After installation, there is still a lot of configuration to do before you can
start using NAV.

TODO: Write up configuration procedures.
