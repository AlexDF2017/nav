Dependencies
============
This section should specify what packages are needed to build and run NAV.  Be
aware that many of these packages have dependencies of their own.

Build requirements
------------------
To build NAV, you need at least the following:

 * make
 * autoconf
 * ant
 * Perl >= 5.6.0
 * Python >= 2.3.0
 * Java 2 SDK >= 1.4.0
 * Tomcat >= 4 (or compatible Java Servlet API)
 * JavaSnmp >= 1.4 (A.K.A Drexel SNMP)
 * Cheetah Templates

Runtime requirements
--------------------
To run NAV, these software packages are required:

 * Apache2
 * mod_python
 * mod_php >= 4
 * Cricket
 * PostgreSQL >= 7.4
 * rrdtool
 * Cheetah Templates
 * Tomcat >= 4 (or compatible Java Servlet Container)
 * Java 2 SDK >= 1.4.0
 * Perl >= 5.6.0
 * Python >= 2.3.0
 
The following PHP extensions are required:

 * php-gd
 * php-pgsql

The following Perl modules are required:

 * DBD::Pg
 * Pg
 * SNMP_Session (with SNMP_util, BER)

 * egenix-mxdatetime
 * forgethtml
 * forgetsql
 * ipy
 * ldap
 * psycopg
 * rrd


Installing NAV
==============
To install NAV, do the following::

  ./configure
  make
  make install

If you wish to configure NAV to run from a different location than the default
/usr/local/nav you should specify a new directory using the --prefix= option of
the configure script, e.g. "./configure --prefix=/opt/nav".

If you are building an RPM package (or similar) of NAV, you may wish to have
the files installed in a physically different location (a temporary build
directory) than what you configured the package for.  In this case, you should
specify this build directory by adding "DESTDIR=/your/build/directory" to "make
install" command. You should also have a look at whatever .spec files you can
find below the packages/ directory. 

Java libraries
--------------
Before building, you must make sure that the JavaSNMP (from drexel.edu) and the
Java Servlet API are both available on your JVM's CLASSPATH.  If they are not,
you need to explicitly add them to the CLASSPATH environment variable before
running `make` as described above.

If both libraries are located in /usr/share/java/, then something like this
should be appropriate::

  export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/servletapi.jar:/usr/share/java/libsnmp.jar
