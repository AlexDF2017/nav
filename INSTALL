Dependencies
============
This section should specify what packages are needed to build and run NAV.
To build NAV, you need at least the following:

make
autoconf
ant
Perl >= 5.6.0
Python >= 2.2.0
Java 2 SDK >= 1.4.0
Tomcat >= 4 (or compatible Java Servlet API)
JavaSnmp >= 1.4

Installing NAV
==============
To install NAV, do the following:

# ./configure
# make
# make install

If you wish to configure NAV to run from a different location than the
default /usr/local/nav you should specify a new directory using the
--prefix= option of the configure script, e.g. "./configure
--prefix=/opt/nav".

If you are building an RPM package (or similar) of NAV, you may wish
to have the files installed in a physically different location (a
temporary build directory) than what you configured the package for.
In this case, you should specify this build directory by adding
"DESTDIR=/your/build/directory" to "make install" command.

Java Servlet API
----------------

If a Java Servlet API library is not available on the Java classpath
at build time, the build will fail.  You need to explicitly set the
classpath to point to this library before running `make` above.  If
the servlet API is, for example, located in
/usr/share/java/servletapi5.jar on your system, you should issue the
following on the bash command prompt before running make:

  export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/servletapi5.jar


Configuring NAV
===============
After installation, there is still a lot of configuration to do before you can
start using NAV.

TODO: Write up configuration procedures.
