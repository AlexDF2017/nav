Dependencies
============
This section should specify what packages are needed to build and run NAV.
To build NAV, you need at least the following:

make
autoconf
Perl >= 5.6.0
Python >= 2.2.0
Java 2 SDK >= 1.4.0
Cheetah


Installing NAV
==============
To install NAV, do the following:

# ./configure
# make
# make install

If you wish to configure NAV to run from a different location than the
default /usr/local/nav you should specify a new directory using the
--prefix= option of the configure script, e.g. "./configure
--prefix=/opt/nav".

If you are building an RPM package (or similar) of NAV, you may wish
to have the files installed in a physically different location (a
temporary build directory) than what you configured the package for.
In this case, you should specify this build directory by adding
"DESTDIR=/your/build/directory" to "make install" command.


Configuring NAV
===============
After installation, there is still a lot of configuration to do before you can
start using NAV.

TODO: Write up configuration procedures.
