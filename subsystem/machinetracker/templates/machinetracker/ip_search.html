    <h4>Accuracy of the Results</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            IP search results are based on ARP data from routers. Typically ARP
            data entries are kept by the routers 4 hours after the last packet
            seen.  Also keep in mind, the ARP collector only runs twice an hour
            (0,30).  Subtracting 4-4.5 hours from the end time gives you a
            fairly good idea.
        </li>
        <li>
            Since NAV 3.3 port numbers have been removed from the search in
            favor of interface names.  Historical search results will still
            contain port numbers instead of interface names, as historical port
            number data cannot be accurately mapped to interface names.
        </li>
        <li>
            Checking the &quot;inactive&quot; checkbox will have no effect when
            searching IPv6 address ranges.  The output would be huge (about
            <em>10<sup>19</sup></em> resulting rows for a /64 subnet).
        </li>
    </ul>
