Mostly for internal NAV usage.

Usage:  hasPrivilege.py subject action target

  subject  - The login name of the user that requests the privilege
  action   - The name of the privilege requested
  target   - Specification of that the privilege is requested for

Exit codes:
  If the privilege was granted, the return code is 0.  If not, the
  return code is 1.
  If the script encountered errors during privilege checking, the
  return code will be > 1.

Example: hasPrivilege.py admin web_access /useradmin/index
