In this directory we have the mail-templates. The templates are used
when Arnold sends out mails to the people responsible for a computer.

You specify the name of the template Arnold uses on the website. Or if
you manually run Arnold use the -m option. 

A template is easy to make. It consist of a from-address, a subject
and whatever text you want to include. There are some variales
available for you to make the template more informative:

$reason - the reason for this block
$list - the list of ip-addresses blocked

A mailtemplate may look like this (the START and EOF are for your
readability only):


START
noreply@university.com
Computers blocked because of $reason.

Some informative text.

The following computers have been blocked:

$list


Contact-information.
