# file view-groups 

# At the moment '#' is used for comments, but anything that not starts
# with the word 'view' will be ignored.

# This file is inteded to group the views for the targettypes. In a
# targettype we have two config-options: ds and view. ds (datasource)
# defines what datasources to gather from on this targettype, while
# view defines how the grapher.cgi groups the different graphs. So for
# instance we have one group for cpu-graphs, one for memory graphs and
# so on.

# Every line that start with 'view' defines a group. In a group we
# have all possible members of that group. Some targettypes may not
# include all members, for instance the group temp has 3 groupmembers
# (tempInlet, tempOutlet and tempState) but not every targettype with
# the view temp may include all those three.
