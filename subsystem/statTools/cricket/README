Contents of statTools/cricket
=============================

This directory contains files for a default NAV-installation of
Cricket. It is divided into three directories named after the Cricket
counterpart. You should find the same directories in any
Cricket-install if you have followed the instructions in the document
"Installing Cricket for the Complete Beginner"
(http://cricket.sourceforge.net/support/doc/beginner.html).

To make use of these files, just issue a copy command directly to the
cricket installation directory, and confirm to overwrite any existent
files. 

NB! The files in this directory does not merge very well with the
existent files in a Cricket installation. You are meant to use these
files if and only if you have a completely clean installation of
Cricket. If you have made your own local modifications to the cricket
configuration, copy and paste the needed configuration from these
files to your own cricket installation.


The directories contain the following configuration:


cricket
-------

In the directory "cricket" you will find a sample "subtree-sets"
file. This file contains configuration necessary for the collector to
start collecting data on a basic NAV-install of Cricket.

Again, if you already have your own "subtree-sets" file, copy and
paste the relevant information from this file to your existent file. 


cricket-config
--------------

In this directory you will find a sample configuration needed to make
NAV-v3 run data-collection on routers, switches and their
interfaces. In this directory (and it's subdirectories) there are
.nav-files. These files are hidden (because of their .) to make them
invisible to the Cricket-compiler, that otherwise would parse them as
Cricket config-files. 

The files are used to make the job easier for
makecricketconfig.pl. Also remember to compile cricket once before you
run makecricketconfig.pl as the script depends on information from the
database (config.db) that is created during a cricket-compile.

Both the .nav and other files in this directory may be tampered with
if you want, but please make sure that you understand how things work
before you do that. 


public_html
-----------

In this directory there is only a simple css-file to make the Cricket
web-page a bit more candy for the eye. If you already have a css-file,
feel free to use your own, but test this one to see if you like the
result better. Who knows, you may be pleased with the result.
