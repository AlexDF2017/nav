This directory contains a number of tools that we use regarding the
use of RRDTool and Cricket in NAV. 

cleanrrds.pl
============
This script finds all the rrd-files that we are using. The purpose of
the script is to delete all the rrd-files that are no longer active,
to save disk-space.

It works after the following principle:
- if a rrd-file is found and is in the database, leave it alone.
- if a rrd-file is found that is not in the database, check the last
update-time. If the time for last update is less than 2 weeks ago,
leave it alone.
- otherwise delete the file.

cricketoids.txt
===============
This file contains all the oid's with description that Cricket uses to
gather data. Every row contains up to 3 columns:
1 - the oidname
2 - the sequence of numbers that constitute the oid
3 - (optional) a description of the oid

filloiddb.pl
============
This script takes the info from the cricketoids.txt file and puts it
into the database. This script will most probably only be used during
install to fill the database. There should be no other normal use,
except for if the database for some reason has to be refilled.

filltypesnmpoid.pl
==================
This script tries to detect what oid's the units in the database
answer to. This is done by grouping by typename, then selecting two
random units of that type from the database, and then querying them
with all the cricketoids located in the snmpoid-table. Using some
logic it decides what oid's returned a sane answer and stores the
connection type<->oid in the typesnmpoid-table.

makecricketconfig.pl
====================
This complex script makes the config-tree that Cricket uses. For more
detailed information, check the documentation in the script.
