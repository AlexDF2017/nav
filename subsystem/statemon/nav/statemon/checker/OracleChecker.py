    Description:
    ------------
    This checker tries to connect to a given Oracle database.
    
    The checker relies on that the neccesary Oracle software have been
    installed and that the following Oracle environment variables
    have been set:

    - $ORACLE_HOME
    - $NLS_LANG

    
    Arguments:
    ----------
    hostname: Accessible from self.getAddress() as pure FQDN hostname
    port    : Remote tcp-port where Oracle Listener is living. Default is 1521.
    sid     : Database SID
    username: An Oracle database account with the following permissions:
              - CREATE SESSION 
              - ALTER SESSION
              - select on sys.v_$instance
    password: Password for the Oracle database account.


    Return values:
    --------------
    Succesful connection:
        return Event.UP, "Oracle " + version
    Failure to connect:
        return Event.DOWN, str(sys.exc_value)
