INSTALL OF THRESHOLDMONITOR ON NAV-V3
=====================================

Contact: John Magne Bredal <bredal@itea.ntnu.no>
Version: ALFA


DOWNLOAD
========

The files needed for this subsystem should all be included in the
NAV-v3 package

The system currently consists of two python-scripts:
- thresholdMon.py -> the main program that monitors the rrd-files and
  sends alerts.
- fillthresholds.py -> a program that initially goes through the
  database and sets the correct values on the rrd-files we are going
  to monitor

A user-interface for setting thresholds is to be made. Because of the
unfinished state of this, it is not included in the ALFA-version of
NAV-v3. 


DEPENDENCIES
============

The scripts in this subsystem are dependent only on modules that
should already be installed in NAV-v3

The user of the script should have the PYTHONPATH variable set correctly.

LOCATION OF INSTALL
===================

Both the files are to be placed in the ${NAV_PREFIX}/bin directory.


RUNNING THE SCRIPTS
===================

fillthresholds.py is only supposed to be run at the install of
NAV-v3. This script sets the inital thresholds that are used by the
thresholdMon.py script. If run more than once it will ignore all set
thresholds, so there is no danger involved in that.

thresholdMon.py is supposed to be run as a cron-job every 5'th
minute. This will automatically happen if you do the "nav start
thresholdmon" command as root.
