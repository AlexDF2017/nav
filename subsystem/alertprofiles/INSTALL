INSTALLATION
------------
* First, the database will be initiated (created) automaticly during installation of NAV.
	The sql script required for AlertProfiles is etc/conf/db/navprofiles.sql
* The folder "alertengine" should be copied inside webroot.
* Now the alert profiles would hopefully be up and running at the webaddress:
	http://installationhost/alertprofiles or by choosing toolbox>alertprofiles 
	from the main page after login.
* AlertProfiles is built and tested on PHP Version 4.1.2. If installed on a server running
	PHP 4.2 or newer, register globals have to be turned on. This is done by editing
	/etc/php.ini and alter the line "register_globals = Off" to "register_globals = On".
* AlertProfiles needs info to connect to the database to run at all. Username and password is
	fetched dynamically from "/usr/local/nav/local/etc/conf/db.conf". This file should be
	automaticly set up properly during installation.


AlertProfiles requires PHP to be built with the following parameters:
	--with-gd --with-png --with-gettext 
	and with support for postgresql.
	A default installation probably includes all this.

After installation the administrator will be advised to setup a pool of useful equipment filters 
and groups. More information about this is found in the user manual, avaiable for download under
the help section in the alertprofiles webinterface.

Good luck.
