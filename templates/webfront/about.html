  Network Administration Visualized is an advanced software suite to monitor
  large computer networks. It automatically discovers network topology,
  monitors network load and outages, and can send alerts on network events by
  e-mail and SMS, allowing for flexible configuration of alert profiles.

  NAV was originally developed at the Norwegian University of Science and
  Technology (<a href="http://www.ntnu.no/">NTNU</a>) since 1999, to meet the
  needs of the university's campus network operators.  The Norwegian national
  research network, <a href="http://www.uninett.no/index.en.html">UNINETT</a>,
  became involved in 2001, and has been leading the development of NAV since
  2006, on behalf of all universities and university colleges in Norway.
